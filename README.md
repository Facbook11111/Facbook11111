    <h3>I am (mostly) a website developer; I work for myself. Yippee!</h3>

    <p>I am a fanatic of coding languages. I love them. Not PHP though. I hate PHP. If you ask me to code in PHP for you, I will be extremely upset.</p>
    <p>I am experienced in (and mainly use), HTML, CSS, JS, PYTHON, PHP, LARAVEL, and LUA.</p>
    <h6>However, I am also somewhat familar with C++ and JAVA aswell.</h6>
